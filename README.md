# Projects

## [Qosmetics](https://github.com/Qosmetics/Qosmetics)
A mod suite for replacing models in Beat Saber for Oculus Quest, allowing users to swap out the default walls, blocks and sabers for custom community made ones!

Programmed in c++ this has been my major mod that I use to learn new things about the language and try out new cool things with UI
## Other
I have many more other projects that I've worked on, most of them are Oculus Quest Mods, you can mostly find them in my repositories!
