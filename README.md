# Projects

## [Qosmetics](https://github.com/RedBrumbler/Qosmetics)
An Oculus Quest Mod for Beat Saber, allowing users to swap out the default walls, blocks and sabers for custom community made ones!

Programmed in c++ this has been my major mod that I use to learn new things about the language and try out new cool things with UI

## [MonkeComputer](https://github.com/RedBrumbler/MonkeComputer)
An Oculus Quest Mod/Library for Gorilla Tag that allows mod makers to create their own text based custom UI, and adds functionality to the game by making the scoreboard accessible to other players.

This is my learning mod for learning how to make libraries properly available for others to use, and has been very successful in getting me to understand that

## Other
I have many more other projects that I've worked on, most of them are Oculus Quest Mods, you can mostly find them in my repositories!
